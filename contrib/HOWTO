Monitor HTML page HOWTO	version 1.02, 1-21-08

These files and scripts do the following:

dnsbl_monitor.shtml	displays the explanation of how the data
			is created and the historical files available


contrib/mon2html.pl	converts the output of 'dnsblmon -w into a page
contrib/mon2list.pl	converts the history directory into an htmlized list
contrib/mon2page.sh	wraps the above two scripts
contrib/mon2generic.pl	extract the 'GENERIC' criteria from monitor.conf
			file and write an HTML page with the regexp's

Each of the script files will generate a brief HELP 
statement if executed without input arguments

# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # 

This HOWTO assumes that you have installed Net::DNSBL::Monitor, properly
edited the monitor.conf file and that you one or more source files
containing IP addresses. It does not matter if their are duplicates, the
'dnsblmon' script removes duplicates.

*	Edit dnsbl_monitor.shtml to replace the logo image with your own 
	or if you don't have one with "&nbsp;"

*	create the directory structure

	/home/mydirectory/public_html/history
	/home/mydirectory/scripts
	/home/mydirectory/tmp

*	place 'dnsbl_monitor.shtml' in the public_html directory

*	copy the script files to the 'scripts' directory

# MIN HOUR DAY MONTH DAYOFWEEK   COMMAND
# run daily at 10 minutes after midnight

	-r tmp/report.cache \
	-s tmp/stats.cache; \
	./scripts/mon2page.sh tmp/stats.cache tmp/report.cache \
	public_html/history \
	public_html/archive.txt

The script 'mon2list.pl' assumes that the web directory is named

    public{something}

and contains a regexp in the form:

	s|public[^/]*/||

You need to edit this regexp if your HTML web directory is NOT:

	public{something}
