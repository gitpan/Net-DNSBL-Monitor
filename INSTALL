Installation of Net::DNSBL::Monitor is straightforward.

	tar -xzvf Net-DNSBL-Monitor-version.string.tgz
	cd Net-DNSBL-Monitor-version.string

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

Copy the script file 'dnsblmon' and its companion sample
configuration file to the user/directory of your choice.

Edit the configuration file to include those DNSBL's you 
wish to profile and adjust the 'FILES' key to point to
the ip list(s) you wish to use.

Run the script from cron or by hand 

	./dnsblmon path/to/config.file

This will print the report to standard output or you can
pipe it to a file.
