            htmltxt
            plainresp

DESCRIPTION
    Net::DNSBL::Monitor is the Perl module that can be used to check when
    ranges of IP addresses have been blacklisted. Net::DNSBL::Monitor
    generates a statistical report for the DNSBL's interrogated and provides
    an individual report for each IP address found in a DNSBL. The module is
    used to implement the reporting script dnsblmon.

CONFIGURATION FILE
    With the addition of a few elements, the configuration file for dnsblmon
    shares a common format with the Mail::SpamCannibal sc_BLcheck.pl script,
    and Net::DNSBL::Statistics config file, facilitating common maintenance
    of DNSBL's for your MTA installation.

    The sample configuration file monitor.conf.sample is heavily commented
    with the details for each configuration element.

    A useful list of DNSBL zones for the config file (put together by
    "Andrey V. Stolyarov" <croco-gnu@openwall.com>) maybe found in the
    contrib directory "zones4config.file".

SYSTEM SIGNALS
    dnsblmon responds to the following system signals:

    * TERM
      Script is terminated.

PERL MODULE DESCRIPTION - Script Implementation
    Net::DNSBL::Monitor provides most of the functions that implement
    dnsblmon which is a script that collects statistics and responses for a
    list of IP address interrogated against a list of DNSBL's

dnsblmon usage
    How to use dnsblmon

    Syntax: dnsblmon path/to/config.file or dnsblmon -t path/to/config.file
    dnsblmon -w path/to/config.file

            dnsblmon path/to/config.file -r -s
            dnsblmon path/to/config.file -s -r

            dnsblmon path/to/config.file \
                    -r path/outfile1 \
                    -s path/outfile2

    Normally dnsblmon prints an IP report sorted by "comment" and IP of the
    DNSBL's interrogated with their reply results for each IP address.

    The 'comment' field may contain html markup text.

      i.e.  commenta
              1.2.3.4  127.0.0.3  zen.spamhaus.org
                       127.0.0.5  dnsbl.sorbs.net
              1.2.3.5  127.0.0.5  dnsbl.sorbs.net

            commentb
              3.4.5.6 127.0.0.2 bl.spamcannibal.org

    With the (-s) switch, dnsblmon prints a sorted list (by count) of the
    DNSBL's interrogated with their reply count, percentage of the total
    count, and any comments from the DNSBL's 'comment' key field in the
    config file.

    The 'comment' field may contain html markup text.

      i.e.
      44 100.0%  TOTAL IP's interrogated
      41  93.2%  UNION of all results
      34  77.3%  dnsbl.sorbs.net comment
      ........

    The -t switch will print a start and stop time to STDOUT

      i.e.
      # start: Fri Jan  4 17:46:44 2008
      # stop : Fri Jan  4 17:58:21 2008

    The -w switch will put the output into an HTML table without the <table>
    statement </table>., a commment as above and with an <a href="...">dnsbl
    name</a> statement replacing the dnsbl name if the 'url' key is present
    in the config file.

    The -r and -s switchs are position dependent output designators.

      -r    REPORT output designator
      -s    STATISTICS output designator

      as follows:

      -r -s would produce the report on STDOUT and the statistics
            on STDERR.
      -s -r would produce the statistics on STDOUT and the 
            report on STDERR.

      -s outfile1 -r outfile2 would write the statistics and report
            to outfile1 and outfile2 respectively.

    Other combinations are possible. Switches are order dependent but not
    positionally dependent with respect to other switches

dnsblmon input file format
    The input file format for dnsblmon consists of an address element block
    in the form used by NetAddr::IP followed by a 'comment field'. The
    report generated will be sorted on the 'comment field', then by IP
    address.

      i.e.          input format

      1.2.3.4       single host IP belonging to XYZ
      2.3.4.5/24    A class C belonging to ABC hosting
      etc...

Net::DNSBL::Monitor FUNCTIONS
    * ($dnsblcnts,$responses)=run(\%config,$NonBlockSock,$sockaddr_in);
        Returns the total number of IP's interrogated (IP list less white
        listed items) and a hash of DNSBL names and their respective SPAM
        reply counts or equivalent for 'in-addr.arpa' and GENERIC.

          input:   config pointer,
                   non-blocking socket descriptor,
                   sockaddr_in for local DNS host

          returns: pointer to dnsbl count hash
                   pointer to response hash

        The dnsbl count hash will have two added keys:

                TOTAL   the total number of interrogations less whitelist
                UNION   the total number of spam 'hits'

        The response hash will be of the form:

          $response = {
                '1.2.3.4'       => {
                        'COMMENT'       => 'text from comment field for IP range',
                        'bl.xyz.com'    => '127.0.0.2',
                        'bl.abc.net'    => '127.0.0.5',
                },
                etc...
          };

          HINTs:   use Net::NBsocket qw( open_udbNB sockaddr_in );
                   use Net::DNS::ToolKit qw( get_ns );

                   my $sock = open_udpNB();
                   my $sockaddr_in = sockaddr_in(53, scalar get_ns());

    * $text = plaintxt($config,\%dnsbls);
        Generate a plain text report of the form:

          44 100.0%  TOTAL IP's interrogated
          41  93.2%  UNION of all results
          34  77.3%  dnsbl.sorbs.net comment
          22  50.0%  GENERIC comment
          13  29.5%  in-addr.arpa comment
          11  25.0%  cbl.abuseat.org comment
          9   20.5%  list.dsbl.org comment
          2    4.5%  dnsbl.njabl.org comment
          1    2.3%  bl.spamcannibal.org comment
          0    0.0%  dynablock.njabl.org comment

          input:        configuration pointer,
                        dnsbl count hash pointer
          returns:      text buffer

        The 'comment' comes from the config file 'comment' key field for
        each specified DNSBL or is blank if there is no 'comment' key.

    * $html = htmltxt($config,\%dnsbls);
        Generate a report as above but with <tr><td></td></tr> table markup.
        The <table></table> tags are not generated. If there is a 'url' key
        field in the respective DNSBL config entry, the DNSBL name is
        provide with <a href="url">DNSBL</a> tags with the specified 'url'
        as the 'href' value.

          input:        configuration pointer,
                        dnsbl count hash pointer
          returns:      html text buffer

          </tr>

    * $text = plainresp(\%response);
        Generate a plain text report of the form:

          comment string 1      
            ipaddr1  response code  dnsbl
                     response code  dnsbl
                     response code  dnsbl
            ipaddr2  response code  dnsbl

          comment string 2
            ipaddr3  response code  dnsbl
